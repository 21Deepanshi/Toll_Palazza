                                                                                                  How the Project Will Work after arranging all in one
Let's take a closer look at how our project works, where smart ideas meet real-life usefulness.Imagine this: When a car drives up, our special sensor keeps watch, glowing red. When the driver gets their ticket and heads to the gate, something amazing happens. 
The sensor talks to a green light and a motor, making the gate open smoothly after just 9 seconds. The green light shines brightly, showing it's okay to go through.

But what about VIPs with monthly cards who hate waiting in line? They can breeze through the sensor, enter the right password, and the gate opens automatically. But if they get the password wrong, the gate stays closed to keep things safe.

In the event of traffic approaching from an unintended direction, the motion sensor activates, illuminating the leftmost LED to alert drivers and prevent accidents. Think about how great it is when a car waits in front of the ultrasonic sensor and The
motion sensor sees it and knows to stay quiet, so everything stays nice and orderly. With all these clever sensors and lights working together, our project makes life smoother and safer for everyone involved.



                                                                The prototype for the Automatic Toll Plaza aligns closely with the vision articulated in the proposal. Here's how it actualizes that vision:
(a) Automation of Toll Payment Process: The proposal aims to simplify toll payment procedures by automating them. The prototype achieves this by using sensors (motion sensor, ultrasonic sensor) and a keypad to detect vehicles, verify subscriptions, and lift the barrier without manual intervention. 
This aligns with the vision of automating toll plaza operations.

(b) Safety Measures: The proposal emphasizes ensuring the safety of vehicles by preventing mishaps at toll booths. The prototype incorporates a motion sensor to detect traffic approaching from different directions, ensuring that vehicles can stop safely. 
This feature directly addresses the safety concerns outlined in the proposal.

(c) User Convenience: The proposal suggests using a keypad for monthly subscription users to pass through the toll plaza smoothly. The prototype implements this feature by allowing authorized users to enter a password via the keypad, which, when verified, opens the barrier. 
This enhances user convenience and aligns with the proposed vision.
